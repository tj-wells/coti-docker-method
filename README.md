# Coti Node Docker Installation Method

Purpose: Provide an easy method to install, upgrade and maintain Coti nodes, using Docker containers.

This method also provides:
- Automatic SSL certification and renewal
- Automatic upgrades to the latest Coti node version

# Prerequisites

This method requires that you have docker and docker-compose installed.

Instructions for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS are given below. For other OSs you should search for instructions yourself.

<details>
    <summary>Docker and docker-compose instructions for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</summary>
    If you are working on Ubuntu 22.04, I found the following commands useful:

```
# Install docker
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
apt-cache policy docker-ce
sudo apt install docker-ce

# Install docker-compose
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.3.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
docker compose version
```

</details>

# Installation Instructions

## 2. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node.git && cd coti-node
```

## 3. Define your Environment

The `.env` file defines the environment variables needed to run the Coti node. These should be specified in the format

```.env
ACTION="<testnet or mainnet>"
SERVERNAME="<Your desired testnet URL>"
PKEY="<Your private key>"
SEED="<Your seed key>"
VERSION="X.Y.Z"
EMAIL="<Your email address>"
```

where,

- ACTION is set to either of the values "testnet" or "mainnet", depending on your use-case.
- SERVERNAME is your desired testnet URL is in the form "testnet.my-node.com", i.e., including subdomains where applicable, and without 'http(s)://' and 'www.'.
- PKEY is your private key. (See [here](https://cotidocs.geordier.co.uk/wallet-and-kyc/generating-your-seed) for guidance on obtaining your private key.)
- SEED is your wallet's seed. (See [here](https://cotidocs.geordier.co.uk/wallet-and-kyc/generating-your-seed) for guidance on generating a seed for your wallet.)
- EMAIL is the email address associated with your node.

An example .env file, <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node/blob/master/.env.sample" target="_blank">.env.sample</a>, is provided in the repository. You may copy it to start from a valid template file: `cp .env.sample .env`.

# Running Your Node

The node can be run in the foreground, which lets you see the logs, with

```
docker-compose up
```

Once you are confident your node is running correctly, you can safely close the terminal window, which leaves the Docker process running. Alternatively, the containers can be run in the background with

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Depending on your OS and version of docker-compose, the `docker-compose` syntax may need to be modified to `docker compose`.

# Auto-update

This method configures a service called watchtower, which checks for new versions of the Coti software, and performs the update for you.

Can I fix a specific version of my node?
* Yes. To do so, specify the version you would like to set in the `.env` file.
  - For example, to fix the version 3.1.3, add the line `VERSION="3.1.3"` to your .env file.

## Upgrading Your Node Version Manually

The Coti node can be upgraded manually in two steps:

1. Update the new version number in your .env file
2. Run `docker-compose up` to download and run the new version in the foreground, or `docker-compose up -d` to do so in the background

## Available Node Versions

Available Coti Node Versions:

<ul>
  <li>3.1.3</li>
  <li>3.1.2</li>
</ul>

# How are the Docker images built?

Since Coti do not produce Docker images, I have set up a separate repository to build container images for the community.

To ensure that the images are produced in a fully transparent and open-source way, the images are built publicly using Github Actions in <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images" target="_blank">this repository</a>, and pushed to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/atomnode/coti-node/tags" target="_blank">this Dockerhub registry</a>. All of the code and workflow runs involved in the build process are fully automated, transparent, and can be inspected in the github repository linked above.

# Debugging

Below is a list of common errors/problems that have been encountered when setting up the node software, and their solutions.

- `Timeout during connect (likely firewall problem)`
  - For the SSL verification to work, your server needs to be able to accept incoming connections from the internet on ports 80 and 443.
    To get the SSL certificates installed, you will need to allow all inbound connections (0.0.0.0/0) for ports 80 and 443 to your machine. The precise steps for this will vary depending on your VPS provider.

* My node repeatedly reconnects to the network
  - Coti's node manager performs health status checks on your node using port 7070.
  - To allow the node manager to connect to your node, ensure that port 7070 is accessible from the IP addresses
    - "52.59.142.53" for testnet nodes,
    - "35.157.47.86" for mainnet nodes.

If none of the information above helps, you can ask me (<a href="https://twitter.com/tomjwells">@tomjwells</a>), consult GeordieR's valuable <a href="https://cotidocs.geordier.co.uk/" target="_blank">gitbook guide</a>, or to get help from the community, pop a question in the node-operators channel in the [Coti Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wfAQfbc3Df).
